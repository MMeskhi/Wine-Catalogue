                        Devotion to and respect for the land, commitment to nature and the embrace of tradition have
                        guided
                        the wine-growing career of Álvar de Dios Hernández since 2008, the year in which he took over
                        his
                        grandfather Donaciano's century-old vineyards on El Pego's quaternary sand deposits in the Toro
                        Designation of Origin (Zamora).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was the birthplace of Aciano, a red wine joined a year later by the Vagüera white taken
                        from a
                        historic vine in El Maderal (Zamora) on the El Rapadal estate, home to over 12 autochthonous
                        white
                        grape varieties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A year later, another white wine — marketed under the same name but produced from the malvasia
                        variety grown on the Las Mansas estate — joined the stable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2014, Álvar de Dios established his own winery and then, in 2015, expanded into a
                        little-known
                        wine-growing region with huge potential: Arribes del Duero.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From tiny, centuries-old vines, many of them planted on terraces or river bluffs and rooted in
                        soils
                        rich in white slate and pyrite, come wines that capture the age-old taste and culture of the
                        mysterious borderlands in Camino de los Arrieros, Las Vidres and Yavallo.

                            Our organic and biodynamic vineyard management techniques fully respect our local
                            environment and contribute to the recovery and conservation of its autochthonous flora and
                            fauna.

                            <span class="first-word">TRADITION.</span>
                            We follow closely in our ancestor's footsteps, upholding their devotion to their
                            surroundings and their way of interpreting and preserving the habits and culture of the
                            terroir.

                            One of our greatest aims is to produce wines that convey the peculiarities of the
                            land on which they are grown — wines free of artifice, with all the strengths and weaknesses
                            that this brings, that bear the traits of their origins.

                            Nowhere can be understood in isolation without its people. This project's dream is to
                            create bonds with other artisans, micro-enterprises and neighbours to forge a local
                            identity, to grow and to reverse rural depopulation.
